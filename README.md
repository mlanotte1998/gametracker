# Gametracker

The GameTracker project is an IOS app being developed using Swift and XCode.

## General Idea

The main purpose of this app is to track the latest video game releases and how much money I spend on games. The app will have a menu of all the major games being released and that have been released in recent years that can be filtered by the year they came out, the month, the platform, and the release price. Games can be added into a wishlist or a bought list that can also be filtered by the year, month, price, platform, or any combination of them. When a game is bought, the user will be prompted to put in the month and year of purchase, and the purchase price so that games on the bought list can be filtered by these too. This allows the user to see how much they spent on games over certain time periods, and also can see how much money they saved compared to the original sale price. 

Additional features that I plan to add after are the ability for someone to recommend a game to be added to the release list, the ability to search games by genre, and the ability to keep a budget for the user to better handle how much they spend. 

## Current Status

January: Currently very early on in development and spending free time to learn Swift at an intermediate level so that I can find a good place to start with the development.
