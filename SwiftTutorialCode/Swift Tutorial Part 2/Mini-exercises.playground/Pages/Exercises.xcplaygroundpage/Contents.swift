 ## Type Inference
 ### Question 1
 Create a constant called `age1` and set it equal to `42`. Create a constant called `age2` and set it equal to `21`. Check using Option-click that the type for both has been inferred correctly as `Int`. */
let age1 = Double(42)
let age2 = Double(21)

/*:
 ### Question 2
 Create a constant called `avg1` and set it equal to the average of `age1` and `age2` using the naïve operation `(age1 + age2) / 2`. Use Option-click to check the type and check the result of `avg1`. Why is it wrong?
 */
let avg1 = (age1 + age2) / 2

/*:
 ### Question 3
 Correct the mistake in the above exercise by casting `age1` and `age2` to `Double` in the formula. Use Option-click to check the type and check the result of `avg1`. Why is it now correct?
 */

/*:
 ## Strings in Swift
 ### Question 1
 Create a string constant called `firstName` and initialize it to your first name. Also create a string constant called `lastName` and initialize it to your last name. */

/*:
 ### Question 2
 Create a string constant called `fullName` by adding the `firstName` and `lastName` constants together, separated by a space.
 */

/*:
 ### Question 3
 Using interpolation, create a string constant called `myDetails` that uses the `fullName` constant to create a string introducing yourself. For example, my string would read: `"Hello, my name is Lorenzo Boaro."`.
 */

/*:
 ### Question 4
 Using interpolation and multi-line string literals, create a string constant called `myLongDetails` that uses the `fullName` constant to create a long string introducing yourself. For example, my string would read: `"Hello my name is Lorenzo Boaro\nand I'm learning how to use\nmulti-line string literals."`.
 */

/*:
 ## Tuples
 ### Question 1
 Declare a constant tuple that contains three `Int` values followed by a `Double`. Use this to represent a date (month, day, year) followed by an average temperature for that date. */

/*:
 ### Question 2
 Change the tuple to name the constituent components. Give them names related to the data that they contain: `month`, `day`, `year` and `averageTemperature`.
 */

/*:
 ### Question 3
 In one line, read the day and average temperature values into two constants. You’ll need to employ the underscore to ignore the month and year.
 */

/*:
 ### Question 4
 Up until now, you’ve only seen constant tuples. But you can create variable tuples, too. Change the tuple you created in the exercises above to a variable by using `var` instead of `let`. Now change the average temperature to a new value.
